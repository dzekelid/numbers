description: A simple and elegant way to explore cancer data. Sitting above one of
  the deepest and most integratively characterized open cancer datasets in the world.
  Backed by a powerful computational infrastructure, application programming interface
  (API), graphical tools and online reports. With over 80K sample aliquots from 11,000+
  cancer patients, spanning 38 unique disease cohorts.

  x-api-slug: analysescopynumbergenesall-get
  description: 'This service provides access to the Gistic2 all_data_by_genes.txt
    output data. This data is a gene-level table of copy number values for all samples.
    The returned copy number values are in units (copy number - 2) so that no amplification
    or deletion is 0, genes with amplifications have positive values, and genes with
    deletions are negative values. The data are converted from marker level to gene
    level using the extreme method: a gene is assigned the greatest amplification
    or the least deletion value among the markers it covers. Results may be filtered
    by cohort, gene, or barcode, but at least one gene or barcode must be supplied.'
